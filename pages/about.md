# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am a PhD student 🤓 based in London :uk:. I have extensive data analysis experience both inside and outside of academia (6+ years). From sequencing pathogens 🦠 and mutating worms :microscope: to analysing babies 🧠 scans, I have always enjoyed the interdisciplinary environment and the process of challenging myself to new things. Outside of work, I like lifting 🏋️‍♂️, reading war books and listening to comedy podcasts.
