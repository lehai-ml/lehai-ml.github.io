# **About Me**

Hi I am **Hai** :wave:,<br>

I am currently working as a Data Scientist in London. Previously, I trained as a neuroscientist. Over those 9+ years, I worked on different areas, ranging from sequencing pathogens, mutating worms to analysing babies brain scans. Each experience has been both challenging and rewarding in its own way. Over time, Iâ€™ve realised that what I enjoy most is the process of research- whether it is mastering a new pipetting technique or exploring neuroimaging software. With this page, I hope to document my attempts to learn new concepts.
