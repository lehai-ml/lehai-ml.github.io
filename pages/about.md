# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am London-based Vietnamese PhD student, born in Germany and raised in Bulgaria. I have extensive work experience in wet-lab setting (over 3 years) and in data analysis (over 4 years). My works involves analysing Neuroimaing scans, and genetic data. But I am more interested in learning about data analysis in general.
