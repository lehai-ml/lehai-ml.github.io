Hello, my name is Hai. I am a data scientist based in London :uk: currently working in the UK Civil Service. :eyes: My day-to-day work involves maintaining existing machine learning products, communicating data insights to customers and researching new AI technologies. Previously, I completed a PhD on neuroimaging and genetics in newborns. I loved it so much I published several papers and even wrote a [200-page document :closed_book:](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/studentTheses/schizophrenia-and-autism) on it (*bonus point* if you can find my brain scan in it).
