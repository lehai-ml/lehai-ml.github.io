# Introduction

Neural networks are considered black box models due to their complex architecture. While they have great predictive powesrs, it is particularly hard to understand how they arrive at a particular decision. In contrast, linear regression and decision tree models are inherently explainable. For example, the linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the target and the input features; such that the coefficient of the model can indicate the direction of influence of the independent on the dependent variable. Similarly, decision trees have a simple rule-based structure, such that at each node the input feature is compared against a threshold (e.g., is X > than 5). Furthemore, the linear regression and the
